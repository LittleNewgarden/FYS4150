# FYS4150

Repository with project deliveries in the course FYS3150/FYS4150. 

The repository is divided into folders, one for each project, where you can find the C++ and python code files. The files for each project is located in the folder with the same name as the project of interest.

Each project folder includes a README file that explains how to run each code file. Some problems might be solved using the same code file. In that case, the README file explains which code files correspond to which problems as well as how to run them.
